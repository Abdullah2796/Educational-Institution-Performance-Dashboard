# Educational Institution Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze the performance of an educational institution using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into student activities, application statuses, departmental performance, and academic engagement trends. The goal is to assist administrators in making data-driven decisions to optimize student success, streamline operations, and enhance overall institutional performance.

## Features
- **Total Students**  
  Displays the total number of enrolled students across all departments.

- **New Enrollments Today**  
  Tracks the number of new students enrolled on the current day.

- **Pending Applications**  
  Highlights the number of applications that are still under review or pending approval.

- **Courses Assigned**  
  Tracks the total number of active courses assigned to students or instructors.

- **Daily Trend of Student Activities**  
  A line chart visualizing trends in daily student activities, such as attendance, submissions, or participation.

- **Peak Hours of Student Engagement**  
  A heatmap identifying the most active hours of student engagement across the week, aiding in class scheduling and resource allocation.

- **Student Performance by Grade Level**  
  A bar chart showing the academic performance breakdown by grade levels (e.g., Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3).

- **Students per Department**  
  Visualizes the distribution of students across various academic departments (e.g., STEM, Business Administration, Vocational Training).

- **Student Application Status**  
  A donut chart representing the percentage of applications in different statuses, such as Approved, Pending, or Rejected.

- **Pending Applications by Reason**  
  A pie chart categorizing reasons for pending applications (e.g., missing documents, financial clearance).

- **Slicers for Filtering**  
  Interactive filters for date range, application status, course type (Core or Elective), and SLA-breached applications.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**  
  Used to create interactive visuals and dashboards.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
  Used for calculating key metrics, adding business logic, and creating custom aggregations.

## Key Visuals
- **KPI Cards**  
  Highlight key metrics, including total students, new enrollments, pending applications, and assigned courses.

- **Line Charts**  
  Display daily trends of student activities for tracking engagement over time.

- **Heatmap**  
  Identifies peak hours of student engagement throughout the week.

- **Bar Charts**  
  Visualize performance by grade level and student distribution by department.

- **Donut Charts**  
  Represent application statuses (e.g., Approved, Pending) and course types (Core or Elective).

- **Pie Charts**  
  Break down reasons for pending applications for better insight into admissions delays.

- **Slicers**  
  Allow users to filter data interactively by application status, department, and course type.

  Visualizing performance by grade level and department helps administrators identify areas needing support or intervention.

- **Resource Allocation**  
  Data on student distribution across departments aids in allocating faculty and facilities efficiently.

## Conclusion
The **Educational Institution Performance Dashboard** provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics related to student activities, application statuses, and departmental performance. Its interactive visuals allow academic administrators to monitor and optimize processes, ensure timely actions on pending applications, and improve institutional efficiency. This dashboard is an essential tool for data-driven decision-making in educational management.
